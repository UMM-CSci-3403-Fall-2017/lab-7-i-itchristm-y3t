Based on our test runs of our MultipleCalls script, we can conclude that our multithreaded
server is faster than a single threaded server. We ran it on multiple clients ranging from
25 to 100. However, when changing the amount of threads our server uses, we noticed
that running the shell script with only two threads ran faster overall than
when we increased the number of threads.
